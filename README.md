# Project
##About
This project is going to be a web-application, wich will help you to chose interesting musical events in your city, using audio-tab on your [VK-page](http://vk.com)
##How will it operate?
It's assumed, that the application will be able to get a list of user's audiofiles. Than it is to create a database due to identify an artist list within. After that, the server will generate the list of VK-events created for announcing concerts which will take place in user's city in the near future
##Plans
Till the New Year (01.01.2016) I'm planning to realise this features:
- To create a **web-server** which is to provide with VK authentication, when one appeals

The next steps will be the following (some of them may be realised before New Year too):
- To "teach" the server to **create** a database
- To make the server **filling the database** with data of user's audiofiles
- To create the database, containing only **the names of artists**
- To "teach" the server to **find** events on the VK
- To make this search query to match **the pattern**
- To get the **list of required events**
- Create some **GUI**
